List of maintainers and how to submit changes
=============================================

If you wish to submit code, we recommend first reaching out to the maintainers,
who will advise you on the precise procedure they wish to use.

We also request you follow these basic guidelines:

1.  Make sure you test your changes on both a 32- and 64-bit version of Windows.
    (The more versions of Windows you can test on the better).

2.  Make sure your changes do not introduce any new prefast warnings.

3.  Make a patch available to the relevant maintainer in the list. Use 'diff -u'
    to make the patch easy to merge. Be prepared to get your changes sent back
    with seemingly silly requests about formatting and variable names. These
    aren't as silly as they seem. One job the maintainers do is to keep things
    looking the same.

    NOTE that all source should have Unix line endings.

    PLEASE see http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Submitting_Xen_Patches for hints on how
    to submit a patch in a suitable form. Whilst the PV driver source
    repositories are distinct from the Xen Project hypervisor source, we will
    follow the same general patch submission and review process.

    PLEASE try to include any credit lines you want added with the  patch. It
    avoids people being missed off by mistake and makes it easier to know who
    wants adding and who doesn't.

    PLEASE document known bugs. If it doesn't work for everything or does
    something very odd once a month document it.

    PLEASE remember that submissions must be made under the terms of the
    "Developer's Certificate of Origin" (DCO) and should include a
    Signed-off-by: line.

4.  Make sure you have the right to submit any changes you make. If you do 
    changes at work you may find your employer owns the patches instead of 
    you.
