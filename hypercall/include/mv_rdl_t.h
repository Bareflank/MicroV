     * <!-- description -->
     *   @brief A register descriptor list (RDL) describes a list of registers
     *     that either need to be read or written. Each RDL consists of a list
     *     of entries with each entry describing one register to read/write.
     *     Like all structures used in this ABI, the RDL must be placed inside
     *     the shared page. Not all registers require 64 bits for either the
     *     register index or the value itself. In all cases, unused bits are
     *     considered REVI. The meaning of the register and value fields is
     *     ABI dependent. For some ABIs, the reg field refers to a mv_reg_t
     *     while in other cases it refers to an architecture specific register
     *     like MSRs on x86 which have it's index type. The value field for
     *     some ABIs is the value read or the value to be written to the
     *     requested register. In other cases, it is a boolean, enum or bit
     *     field describing attributes about the register such as whether the
     *     register is supported, emulated or permissable. Registers 0-7 in the
     *     mv_rdl_t are NOT entries, but instead input/output registers for the
     *     ABIs that need additional input and output registers. If any of
     *     these registers is not used by a specific ABI, it is REVI.
